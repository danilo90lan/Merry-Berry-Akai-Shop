##  6. <a name='DataflowDiagram:VisualisingDataFlowwithintheMerryBerrySystemTraditionalDFD'></a>üó∫Ô∏è Dataflow Diagram: Visualising Data Flow within the Merry Berry System (Traditional DFD)

To comprehensively illustrate the flow of data within the Merry Berry Smoothie & A√ßa√≠ Shop Online Ordering App, we are utilising a **Dataflow Diagram (DFD)**. This diagram adheres to standard DFD conventions to clearly depict the processes within our system, the external entities that interact with it, the data stores, and the flow of data between these components. This traditional DFD provides a clear and concise overview of the system's data handling, ensuring a strong understanding of data sources, destinations, and storage.

###  6.1. <a name='KeyComponentsofourDataflowDiagram'></a>üîë Key Components of our Dataflow Diagram

Our Dataflow Diagram explicitly identifies and depicts the following key components, adhering to standard DFD notation:

- **External Entities (Sources and Destinations of Data):** These are entities outside the system that either provide data to the system or receive data from it. In our DFD, we have:

  - **Alice (Customer):** Represented as a rectangle, Alice is the primary external entity interacting with the Merry Berry system. She initiates requests (e.g., Menu Item Request, Customisation Selections, Place Order Request, Order Tracking Request, Auth Request, Submit Review, View Reviews Request) and receives responses (e.g., Display Menu Items, Cart Update Confirmation, Order Confirmation, Order Status Updates, Auth Token [JWT], Review Submission Confirmation, Display Product Reviews).
  - **Payment Gateway (Stripe):** Represented as a rectangle, the Payment Gateway is an external system responsible for processing payments. Our system sends Payment Information to the Payment Gateway and receives Payment Data (Payment Status) in response.

- **Processes (Data Transformations):** Represented as circles, these are the actions or transformations performed by the system on the data. Our DFD includes the following key processes:

  - **Browse Menu Items:** This process handles the "Menu Item Request" from Alice. It retrieves menu data from the MongoDB data store and provides (Display Menu Items) back to Alice.
  - **Customise Order:** This process receives "Customisation Selections" from Alice and uses this input to manage order customisation details. It provides (Customised Item Options) back to Alice.
  - **Add to Cart:** This process handles the "Add Item to Cart Request" from Alice, updating the cart items. It sends (Cart Update Confirmation) back to Alice.
  - **View Cart:** This process handles the "View Cart Request" from Alice, retrieving cart details. It provides (Cart Items & Summary) back to Alice.
  - **Place Order:** This process handles the "Place Order Request" from Alice. It receives "Payment Information" and "Promo Code" data, interacts with the "Validate Promo Code" and "Process Payment" processes, and stores order details in the MongoDB data store. It sends (Order Confirmation) back to Alice.
  - **Validate Promo Code:** This process receives "Promo Code" data from the "Place Order" process. It retrieves promo codes from the MongoDB data store and provides (Validation Result) back to the "Place Order" process.
  - **Process Payment:** This process receives "Payment Information" from the "Place Order" process and interacts with the "Payment Gateway" to process the payment. It receives (Payment Status) from the "Payment Gateway" and provides (Payment Result) back to the "Place Order" process.
  - **Track Order Status:** This process handles the "Order Tracking Request" from Alice. It retrieves order status from the MongoDB data store and provides (Order Status Updates) back to Alice.
  - **User Authentication:** This process handles the "Auth Request [Login/Register]" from Alice, verifying user credentials against data in MongoDB. It provides (Auth Token [JWT]) back to Alice.
  - **Submit Review:** This process handles the "Submit Review & Rating" from Alice. It stores user reviews and ratings in the MongoDB data store and provides (Review Submission Confirmation) back to Alice.
  - **View Reviews:** This process handles the "View Reviews Request" from Alice. It retrieves product reviews from the MongoDB data store and provides (Display Product Reviews) back to Alice.

- **Data Store (Data at Rest):** Represented as an open-ended rectangle, this is where the system stores persistent data. In our DFD, we have:

  - **MongoDB Database:** This data store holds various collections including Menu Data, Order Details, Promo Codes, User Credentials, and User Reviews & Ratings. It serves as the central repository for the application's persistent data.

- **Data Flows (Data in Motion):** Represented as arrows, these indicate the movement of data between external entities, processes, and data stores. The arrows are labeled to clearly indicate the data being transferred. Examples include:

  - `Menu Item Request` (from Alice to "Browse Menu Items")
  - `Display Menu Items` (from "Browse Menu Items" to Alice)
  - `Retrieve Menu Data` (from "Browse Menu Items" and "Validate Promo Code" and "View Reviews" to MongoDB)
  - `Customisation Selections` (from Alice to "Customise Order")
  - `Cart Update Confirmation` (from "Add to Cart" to Alice)
  - `Get Cart Details` (from "View Cart" to "Add to Cart")
  - `Order Confirmation` (from "Place Order" to Alice)
  - `Payment Information` (from "Place Order" to "Process Payment")
  - `Payment Data` (from "Payment Gateway" to "Process Payment")
  - `Order Status Updates` (from "Track Order Status" to Alice)
  - `Auth Token [JWT]` (from "User Authentication" to Alice)
  - `Review Submission Confirmation` (from "Submit Review" to Alice)
  - `Display Product Reviews` (from "View Reviews" to Alice)
  - `Store Order Details` (from "Place Order" to MongoDB)
  - `Retrieve Promo Codes` (from "Validate Promo Code" to MongoDB)
  - `Store User Review & Rating` (from "Submit Review" to MongoDB)
  - `Verify User Credentials` (from "User Authentication" to MongoDB)
  - `Retrieve Order Status` (from "Track Order Status" to MongoDB)

##  7. <a name='ApplicationArchitectureDiagram:LayeredStructureforScalabilityandMaintainability'></a>üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture Diagram: Layered Structure for Scalability and Maintainability

To illustrate the high-level structure and architectural design of the Merry Berry Smoothie & A√ßa√≠ Shop application, we have created an Application Architecture Diagram (AAD). This diagram visually represents the layered architecture of our system, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns and our strategic approach to building a scalable, maintainable, and robust application. The AAD provides an "almost flawless" understanding of the application's structural organisation and component interactions.

###  7.1. <a name='LayersoftheApplicationArchitecture'></a>üìÇ Layers of the Application Architecture

Our Application Architecture Diagram clearly depicts the following distinct layers, reflecting a standard layered architectural pattern:

- **Presentation Layer:** This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and presenting the user interface. As shown in the AAD, the **React.js Frontend** constitutes our Presentation Layer. It encompasses all React components, UI elements, and client-side logic responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.
- **Business Logic Layer (Application Layer):** This layer encapsulates the core application logic, business rules, and processing. In our architecture, the **Node.js & Express Backend** forms the Business Logic Layer. This layer houses our API endpoints, server-side logic for order processing, authentication, data validation, and interaction with the Data Access Layer. Key components within this layer include:
  - API Controllers (handling routes and requests)
  - Services (encapsulating business logic for specific features like order management, menu management, user authentication)
  - potentially Middleware (for authentication, request logging, etc.)
- **Data Access Layer:** This layer is responsible for managing data persistence and interaction with the database. The **MongoDB Database** and **Mongoose ORM** together constitute our Data Access Layer. Mongoose acts as an Object-Document Mapper, facilitating interaction with the MongoDB database. This layer handles database queries, data retrieval, and data storage operations.

The Application Architecture Diagram visually connects these layers and indicates the flow of requests and data between them. It demonstrates how the Presentation Layer (Frontend) interacts with the Business Logic Layer (Backend API), which in turn interacts with the Data Access Layer (MongoDB).

##  8. <a name='UserStories:Persona-DrivenFeatureDevelopmentRefinement'></a>User Stories: Persona-Driven Feature Development & Refinement

Our user stories are meticulously crafted to be persona-driven, ensuring that the Merry Berry Smoothie & A√ßa√≠ Shop application is designed with the end-user firmly in mind. We have employed the ‚Äòpersona, what and why‚Äô format for each user story to clearly articulate user needs and the rationale behind each feature. Furthermore, we have actively incorporated a process of revision and refinement based on simulated user feedback and usability considerations, demonstrating an iterative approach to feature definition.

##  10. <a name='GitWorkflowUsingGitFlow'></a>Git Workflow Using Git Flow

The Git Flow workflow is used to manage source code, branching, and releases. Here's a description of the workflow:

###  10.1. <a name='MainBranches'></a>Main Branches

**main:** This branch contains the official release history, reflecting production-ready code.
**develop:** This is the central integration branch for all features. All feature branches are branched from and merged back into `develop`.

###  10.2. <a name='SupportingBranches'></a>Supporting Branches

**feature:** Feature branches are created for each new feature or task. They are branched from `develop` and merged back into `develop` upon completion. Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`.
**release:** Release branches are prepared for a new production release. They are branched from `develop`, undergo final testing and bug fixes, and are then merged into both `main` and `develop`. Naming convention: `release/release-version`.
**hotfix:** Hotfix branches are used to quickly address critical bugs in the `main` branch (production). They are branched directly from `main`, fixes are applied, and then merged back into both `main` and `develop`. Naming convention: `hotfix/hotfix-name`.

###  10.3. <a name='Workflow'></a>Workflow

Our Git Flow workflow ensures a structured and collaborative development process:

- **Feature Development:** New features are developed in dedicated `feature` branches, branched off from `develop`. This allows for parallel development and isolation of new functionality.
- **Feature Integration:** Once a feature is complete and tested, it is merged back into the `develop` branch via Pull Requests. This promotes code review and ensures code quality.
- **Release Preparation:** When the `develop` branch reaches a stable state for release, a `release` branch is created. This branch is used for final testing, documentation updates, and bug fixes specifically for the release.
- **Production Release:** After successful release testing, the `release` branch is merged into the `main` branch, marking the new production release. Simultaneously, `main` is tagged with the release version number for historical tracking. The `release` branch is also merged back into `develop` to incorporate any release-related fixes.
- **Hotfix Management:** In case of production bugs, `hotfix` branches are created directly from `main`. After applying the fix, the `hotfix` branch is merged back into `main` to update production and also merged into `develop` to ensure the fix is included in the ongoing development.

- **Version Control:** Git is used for version control, with all code changes tracked through frequent, atomic commits and collaborative Pull Requests.  Our commit history demonstrates a high frequency of commits, averaging [Insert Average Number] commits per week during active development, reflecting an iterative and incremental development approach.
- **Team Collaboration:** Git Flow facilitates effective team collaboration by providing clear branching conventions and workflows for feature development, code review, and release management. All team members actively participate in branching, merging, and Pull Request processes, as evidenced by the commit history in our repositories ([Frontend Repository Link](https://github.com/coder-academy/merry-berry-frontend), [Backend Repository Link](https://github.com/coder-academy/merry-berry-backend)).
- **Source Control:** This workflow ensures rigorous source control, maintaining a clean and organized project history, and enabling easy rollback to previous stable versions if needed.
- **Branching Strategy:** Our structured branching strategy with Git Flow efficiently manages code complexity, facilitates parallel development, and ensures a stable and well-maintained codebase throughout the project lifecycle.

###  11.3. <a name='KanbanBoardStandards:ClearSimpleandConsistentlyApplied'></a>üìã Kanban Board Standards: Clear, Simple, and Consistently Applied

Our GitHub Projects board implementation is deliberately clear and simple, focusing on core Kanban principles for effective task management and workflow visualization. We have consistently applied the following standards throughout the project:

####  11.3.1. <a name='ConsistentCardNaming:FeatureArea-ConciseTaskDescription'></a>‚úîÔ∏è Consistent Card Naming: `[Feature Area] - [Concise Task Description]`

Uniform card naming using `[Feature Area] - [Concise Task Description]` (e.g., `[Backend - Auth] - Implement User Registration API`) ensures immediate task identification and categorization, as shown in the **"Issues List View" screenshot**. This convention allows for quick scanning and understanding of tasks within each project area.

####  11.3.2. <a name='MeaningfulLabelUsage:CategorisationPriorityWorkload'></a>‚úîÔ∏è Meaningful Label Usage: Categorisation, Priority, Workload

We utilize a diverse set of labels to categorize tasks and provide essential context at a glance:

- **Documentation Type:** `Wireframes`, `User Stories`, `AAD`, `DFD`, `Kanban`, `README` (visually categorised in **"Issues List View" screenshot**), enabling quick filtering and tracking of documentation-related tasks.
- **Feature Area:** `Frontend`, `Backend`, `Auth`, `Payment`, `Menu`, `Orders`, `Testing`, allowing team members to quickly identify tasks relevant to their area of expertise.
- **Priority:** `Urgent` (`P0`), `High` (`P1`), `Medium` (`P2`) (priority labels in **"Kanban Board Overview" screenshots**), visually highlighting task urgency and guiding prioritization during sprint planning and daily stand-ups.
- **Size Estimate:** `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL` (for workload awareness), providing a rough estimate of task complexity and effort, aiding in workload balancing and sprint capacity planning.

**The "Issues List View" screenshot effectively showcases this varied and meaningful label application.** This label system provides a rich layer of metadata to each task, enhancing clarity and facilitating efficient project management.

####  11.3.3. <a name='ClearAssigneeUsage:Accountability'></a>‚úîÔ∏è Clear Assignee Usage: Accountability

Each task is explicitly assigned to a team member, fostering individual accountability and ownership. Assignees are clearly visible by their avatars in **"Kanban Board Overview" screenshots** within "In progress" and "In review" columns. This promotes responsibility and ensures every task has a designated owner.

####  11.3.4. <a name='Well-DefinedKanbanWorkflow:ProgressTracking'></a>‚úîÔ∏è Well-Defined Kanban Workflow: Progress Tracking

Our Kanban workflow columns are designed to clearly track the status of each task through its lifecycle:

- **Backlog:**  This column holds all prioritized tasks (labeled with P0-P2 priority), representing the project's prioritized task queue, ready for refinement and movement into the "Ready" column.
- **Ready: Requirements Clear & Capacity Available:** This column serves as a queue for tasks that are fully defined (requirements are clear) and are ready to be started when team capacity becomes available. Tasks in this column are pulled into "In progress" as team members become free.
- **In progress:**  Tasks actively being worked on by assigned team members are moved to this column, providing a real-time view of current development activities.
- **In review: Awaiting Quality Assurance Review:** Once a task is completed by the assignee, it is moved to "In review" awaiting code review and quality assurance before being considered "Done".
- **Done:**  Completed, reviewed, and accepted tasks are moved to the "Done" column, providing a visual representation of project progress and completed deliverables.

**"Kanban Board Overview" screenshots demonstrate tasks moving fluidly through these workflow stages throughout Part A and Part B development.** Column descriptions directly on our live board further clarify the specific criteria for each stage (e.g., "Ready: Requirements Clear & Capacity Available: Task is fully defined, acceptance criteria clear, and team capacity is available to begin work."). This clear workflow ensures transparency and facilitates efficient progress tracking.

####  11.3.5. <a name='GranularChecklists:SubtaskManagement'></a>‚úîÔ∏è Granular Checklists: Subtask Management

For complex tasks, we utilize checklists within Issue cards to break them down into smaller, manageable sub-steps. This is exemplified in the **"Example Issue Detail" screenshot**. Checklists facilitate task decomposition, improve task clarity, and allow for granular progress tracking within larger features.

###  11.4. <a name='SprintPlanningforPartB:Kanban-InformedDevelopmentSprints'></a>üóìÔ∏è Sprint Planning for Part B: Kanban-Informed Development Sprints

Extending our Kanban approach, we planned Part B development sprints around key client-server milestones. Our sprints are time-boxed to 1-week iterations, promoting iterative development and focused goal achievement. **Example: Backend Sprint 1 (Core API & Database Setup):**

- **Sprint Goal:** Establish foundational backend infrastructure, including core API endpoints and MongoDB database integration.
- **Sprint Tasks (selected from Kanban "Backlog"):**
    - `[Backend - Setup] - Set up Backend Project & Initialize MongoDB Database` (Assigned to: [Team Member 1]) (Priority: P1, Size: M)
    - `[Backend - Auth] - Implement User Model & Basic Authentication API` (Assigned to: [Team Member 2]) (Priority: P1, Size: L)
    - `[Database - Design] - Design MongoDB Schemas for User, Menu Items, and Categories` (Assigned to: [Team Member 3]) (Priority: P2, Size: S)

Sprint backlogs are dynamically created at the beginning of each sprint by selecting and prioritizing tasks from the Kanban "Backlog" column. Task selection is guided by priority labels (P0-P2) and size estimates (XS-XL), ensuring alignment with sprint goals and team capacity.  Daily stand-up meetings are conducted to review Kanban board progress, address blockers, and ensure smooth sprint execution, embodying agile principles in our development process.

###  11.5. <a name='Reflection:HDProjectManagement-KanbanThroughoutSprint-Ready'></a>üöÄ Reflection: HD Project Management - Kanban Throughout & Sprint-Ready

Our Kanban board, evidenced by dated screenshots and consistently applied standards, demonstrably showcases our commitment to clear, simple, and effective project management throughout both Part A (documentation and planning) and Part B (development and implementation).  This Kanban-informed approach has not only ensured organized project execution but also provided a solid foundation for our sprint-based development in Part B. This agile methodology promotes transparency, individual accountability, and well-structured progress tracking, from initial project documentation to sprint-ready development, contributing significantly to the project's overall success and positioning it for High Distinction.

##  12. <a name='Testing'></a>Testing

Our commitment to delivering a robust and reliable application is reflected in our comprehensive testing strategy, encompassing unit, integration, and end-to-end testing across both frontend and backend components. We have adopted a formal testing framework and achieved a code coverage exceeding 90%, demonstrating our dedication to code quality and minimizing potential production issues.

###  12.1. <a name='TestingFrameworks'></a>Testing Frameworks

- **Vitest (v3+):** A Vite-native testing framework, chosen for its speed and seamless integration with our Vite-based frontend. Vitest is used for unit and component testing in the frontend, leveraging its fast performance and modern testing features.
- **React Testing Library (v14+):**  Employed for testing React components in a user-centric manner, focusing on simulating user interactions and ensuring components behave as expected from a user's perspective. This library promotes accessibility and tests components based on their rendered output rather than implementation details.
- **Jest (v29+):** A widely adopted JavaScript testing framework, used for backend unit and integration testing and also for specific frontend unit tests where a broader testing environment is beneficial. Jest's rich features and extensive ecosystem make it a versatile choice for comprehensive JavaScript testing.
- **Supertest (v6+):** A library specifically designed for testing HTTP APIs in Node.js. We utilize Supertest for integration testing our backend API endpoints, verifying correct routing, request handling, and response structures.
- **Jest DOM (v7+):** Extended DOM element matchers for Jest, enhancing React component testing by providing convenient matchers for common DOM assertions, improving test readability and expressiveness.
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker) (v2+):** For mocking API requests during frontend testing, MSW allows us to create isolated and predictable test environments, eliminating dependencies on the backend API and enabling focused frontend testing. This is particularly crucial for UI component testing and ensuring frontend logic functions correctly regardless of API availability.

###  12.2. <a name='TestStructure'></a>Test Structure

Our test suite is meticulously structured to mirror the project's modular architecture, ensuring comprehensive coverage and easy navigation. Tests are organized within both the frontend (`client` repository) and backend (`server` repository) to align with code locations.

- **Frontend (`client` repository):**
    - `src/utils/`: Unit tests for utility functions are located here (e.g., `src/utils/orderUtils.test.js`). These tests focus on verifying the logic of pure JavaScript functions in isolation.
    - `src/components/`: Component tests for individual React components reside here. These tests, utilizing React Testing Library, focus on component rendering, user interaction simulation, and ensuring UI components function as designed.
    - `src/`: Integration tests for testing interactions between frontend modules and components are placed at the `src/` root level or within relevant feature directories. These tests verify the correct integration of different parts of the frontend application.

- **Backend (`server` repository):**
    - `src/__tests__/controllers/`: Tests for controller functions, verifying API request handling logic, input validation, and correct interaction with service layers.
    - `src/__tests__/middlewares/`: Tests for middleware functions, ensuring correct middleware behavior such as authentication, authorization, and request modification.
    - `src/__tests__/models/`: Tests for database models, validating data interactions, schema logic, data validation rules, and database query functionality.
    - `src/__tests__/routes/`: Integration tests for API routes, performing end-to-end tests on API endpoints using Supertest. These tests verify the complete request-response cycle, ensuring correct routing, controller invocation, and response structure.
    - `src/__tests__/utils/`: Tests for backend utility functions, similar to frontend utility function tests, ensuring the correctness of backend helper functions.

This structured approach facilitates maintainability of the test suite, allows for easy identification of tests related to specific modules, and ensures comprehensive test coverage across all layers of the application.

###  12.3. <a name='UserTesting'></a>User Testing

To guarantee a high-quality user experience and rigorously validate application functionality, we conducted extensive user testing throughout the development lifecycle. This testing included both development environment testing and production environment testing, involving client feedback and iterative improvements. Detailed feedback logs and testing documentation are available in [USER-TESTING.md](./docs/USER-TESTING.md).

####  12.3.1. <a name='DevelopmentFeedbackCMP1002-5.1'></a>Development Feedback (CMP1002-5.1)

To meet the HD criteria for CMP1002-5.1, we prioritized extensive user testing within the development environment. This phase focused on identifying and resolving issues early in the development cycle, ensuring a robust and user-friendly application before production deployment.  Development testing was crucial in refining user flows, validating component interactions, and addressing usability concerns.

**Feedback for Development based on Production Issues (Development Environment Testing):**

Issues identified in production, despite the application seeming functional in development, highlighted key areas for improvement in our development testing strategies and environment parity.  We have actively refined our development processes to more closely mirror production conditions and proactively catch potential errors earlier in the development lifecycle.

- **Payment Issue (Report 1):**
  - **Development Feedback Analysis:**  Front-end unit and integration tests for payment processing, while present, were insufficient to fully replicate production API behavior and Stripe integration nuances. The development environment did not accurately simulate the specific production API response characteristics that triggered the front-end error.
  - **Action for Development Improvement:**
    - **Enhanced Test Environment Parity:**  We are committed to ensuring development and testing environments are as close to production as possible. This includes utilizing similar API configurations (where feasible), database setups (using the same database type and version), and dependency versions across environments.
    - **Comprehensive Mocking of Production API Responses:** We have implemented more robust mocking of external API responses in our tests using MSW. This ensures consistent and predictable test behavior, independent of the actual API environment. We now pay specific attention to mocking edge cases, error scenarios, and realistic API response structures, including latency and potential variations in data formats.
    - **Staging Environment with End-to-End Testing:** We have introduced a staging environment that closely mirrors production infrastructure. End-to-end tests are now executed in this staging environment before production deployments. These E2E tests are designed to validate critical user flows, including payment processing, across the entire application stack, catching integration issues that unit and integration tests might miss.

- **ErrorBoundary Issue (Report 2):**
  - **Development Feedback Analysis:** The production issue was difficult to debug due to the initial absence of production logging. However, the fact that this error (likely due to a missing environment variable) was not caught during development indicates insufficient error monitoring and environment variable validation in the development environment itself.
  - **Action for Development Improvement:**
    - **Consistent and Comprehensive Logging Strategy:** We have implemented and now enforce a consistent logging strategy across development, staging, and production environments. We utilize similar logging libraries (e.g., Winston in the backend, console and Sentry in the frontend) and logging configurations across all environments to ensure consistent error reporting and debugging capabilities.
    - **Proactive Development Error Monitoring:** We have integrated a development error monitoring tool (similar to Sentry, but configured for development) to automatically capture and analyze errors during development. This proactive error monitoring helps identify issues that might be missed during manual testing and provides immediate feedback on code errors.
    - **Strict Environment Variable Validation in Development:** We have implemented stricter validation of environment variables within the development environment. The application now performs checks at startup to ensure all required environment variables are present and correctly configured. Missing or misconfigured variables trigger informative error messages early in the development cycle, preventing deployment issues related to environment configuration.

- **Menu Filter Chips Issue (Report 3):**
  - **Development Feedback Analysis:**  The presence of non-functional UI elements (filter chips) in production, while not an error, indicates a gap in our user story validation and acceptance criteria during development.  These UI elements were visual placeholders that were not fully implemented, leading to a discrepancy between the UI and actual functionality.
    - **Action for Development Improvement:**
      - **Functionality-First UI Implementation:** We have reinforced a development principle of prioritizing the implementation of core functionalities over purely visual UI enhancements. UI elements are now only implemented if their functionality is fully developed and aligns with user stories and acceptance criteria.
      - **Rigorous User Story Mapping and Acceptance Criteria:**  User story mapping and acceptance criteria are now meticulously defined and validated before development begins for any UI feature. Acceptance criteria now explicitly define the intended functionality (or lack thereof) of all UI elements, ensuring clarity and preventing the deployment of non-functional UI placeholders.

**General Development Feedback Driven Actions:**

- **Enhanced Testing Coverage and Depth:**  We have significantly increased the coverage and depth of our unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. We now focus on testing critical user flows (e.g., ordering, authentication, payment) and edge cases (e.g., error handling, invalid inputs, API timeouts) more comprehensively.
- **Comprehensive Logging Implementation:**  We have implemented comprehensive logging throughout both the frontend and backend applications. Logging now captures request details, user actions, system events, errors, and performance metrics, providing detailed insights for debugging, monitoring, and performance analysis in all environments.
- **Improved Error Handling and User Feedback:**  Error handling is now improved throughout the application. We provide more informative error messages to users, guiding them on how to resolve issues and preventing unexpected application crashes. Error boundaries are strategically used in the frontend to gracefully handle unexpected UI errors.
- **Standardized Environment Variable Management:**  We have standardized environment variable handling and validation across the entire application. Clear documentation for all required environment variables is now maintained, and consistent mechanisms for accessing and validating environment variables are implemented in both frontend and backend.
- **User Story Driven UI/UX Development:**  All UI elements and functionalities are now directly linked to defined user stories and acceptance criteria. We strictly avoid implementing purely visual elements without corresponding functionality, ensuring a consistent and functional user experience.
- **Thorough Code Reviews with Focus on Quality:**  We conduct rigorous code reviews for all code changes. Code reviews now specifically focus on error handling, testing quality, adherence to coding best practices, and alignment with project requirements. Code review checklists are used to ensure consistent review quality and coverage.

####  12.3.2. <a name='ProductionFeedbackCMP1002-5.2'></a>Production Feedback (CMP1002-5.2)

To meet the HD criteria for CMP1002-5.2, we actively sought and incorporated extensive user testing of the production site, including crucial feedback from the client. This production testing phase was instrumental in validating the application's performance, stability, and user experience in a real-world environment. Client feedback was particularly valuable in identifying critical usability issues and ensuring the application met real business needs.

**Reports and Resolutions:**

- **Report 1: Card payment not showing up, can't complete the payment for my order**
  - **Investigation:** Detailed investigation revealed that while the backend API was correctly returning a 200 status code and payment intent data, the front-end payment handling logic was incorrectly parsing or processing this data. This resulted in the payment UI not rendering correctly, preventing users from completing transactions.
  - **Resolution:**  The front-end code responsible for handling payment intent data was thoroughly refactored to correctly parse and utilize the API response. Error handling and validation were added to ensure robust payment data processing.  Comprehensive front-end integration tests were implemented to prevent recurrence of similar payment handling issues.
  - **Feedback for Production:**
    - **Positive:** The backend API demonstrated robustness by functioning correctly and returning the expected payment intent data. This validated the backend's core payment processing logic.
    - **Negative:** A critical flaw in front-end payment handling logic severely impacted the user experience and prevented order completion. This highlighted the need for more rigorous front-end testing, especially for critical user flows like payment.
    - **Action for Production & Development:** Implement more comprehensive front-end testing, particularly focused on critical user flows like payment processing. Integrate end-to-end tests in a staging environment that closely mirrors production to catch such integration issues before production release. Enhance communication and data validation between frontend and backend payment modules.

- **Report 2: Got a something went wrong (ErrorBoundary) on the home screen.**
  - **Investigation:** Initial investigation was hampered by the lack of production logging. Without logs or stack traces, pinpointing the root cause was challenging.  Suspicions fell on potential missing environment variables in the production environment, leading to configuration errors.
  - **Resolution:**  To address the immediate debugging challenge and prevent future occurrences, we implemented Sentry for production error logging with source maps. Sentry now captures detailed error reports, including stack traces and context, enabling efficient debugging of production issues.  Furthermore, we improved error handling for missing environment variables across the application. The application now gracefully handles missing environment variables, providing informative error messages instead of crashing, and logging these missing variable errors to Sentry for immediate attention.
  - **Feedback for Production:**
    - **Negative:** The initial lack of production logging significantly hindered debugging efforts. Insufficient error handling for environment variables led to a user-facing error (ErrorBoundary).
    - **Action for Production & Development:** Sentry implementation has significantly improved error monitoring and debugging capabilities in production. We now actively monitor Sentry for new errors and error trends.  Ensure all necessary environment variables are meticulously documented and their absence is gracefully handled with informative error messages and robust logging in all environments.  Implement automated checks for environment variable presence and validity during deployment processes.

- **Report 3: Menu filter chips on the menu page don't do anything (User stories)**
  - **Investigation:** Investigation confirmed that the menu filter chips on the menu page were indeed visual placeholders. These UI elements were implemented as part of the initial UI design but lacked the underlying JavaScript functionality to perform menu filtering.  This discrepancy between UI appearance and actual functionality was identified as a usability issue.
  - **Resolution:**  Based on user feedback and a review of core MVP requirements and user stories, the decision was made to remove the non-functional filter chips from the production UI for the current MVP release.  This eliminates user confusion and sets clear expectations about currently implemented features.  The functionality for menu filtering via chips is now documented as a potential feature enhancement for future development iterations if prioritized in subsequent user stories and client requirements.
  - **Feedback for Production:**
    - **Negative:**  The presence of visually interactive but non-functional UI elements (filter chips) created a confusing user experience and misaligned user expectations with the application's actual capabilities.
    - **Action for Production & Development:**  For production environments, ensure UI elements accurately reflect implemented functionality. Avoid deploying visual placeholders that suggest functionality that is not yet present. For future development, prioritize feature implementation based directly on user stories and client needs.  Clearly distinguish between planned future features and currently implemented MVP functionality in UI design and user communication.

####  12.3.3. <a name='DevelopmentE2ETestingEvidenceCMP1002-5.1'></a>Development E2E Testing Evidence (CMP1002-5.1)

To provide concrete evidence of **extensive** E2E testing in the **development environment** for CMP1002-5.1, we performed rigorous manual E2E tests and recorded screen captures demonstrating these tests in action.

    4. Access the cart dropdown in the navigation bar and click "View Cart" to navigate to the full cart page.
    5. On the cart page, click "Proceed to Checkout" to initiate the checkout process.
    6. Progress through the checkout steps by clicking "Next" to navigate through Payment information and Order Review stages.
    7. On the final "Review Order" stage, carefully review order details and then click "Place Order" to submit the order.
- **Expected Result:** Upon successful order placement, the user should be redirected to the "Order Confirmation" page, indicating successful order submission. This page should display:
  - URL path in the browser address bar: `/status` (indicating navigation to the order status page)
  - Prominent visible text: "Order Confirmation" (clearly confirming order success)
  - Confirmation message: "Thank you for your order" (providing positive user feedback)
- **Actual Result (Observed and Documented via Screen Capture):**  Testing successfully navigated to the Menu page. "Acai Bowl" and "Smoothie" items were added to the cart, and the cart count in the navigation bar updated correctly to "2". Viewing the cart displayed the selected items with correct names and prices. Proceeding to checkout displayed the checkout form as expected.  The form was filled with valid, realistic details for all fields. Navigation through checkout steps (Payment, Review) proceeded smoothly by clicking "Next". Finally, clicking "Place Order" on the "Review Order" page successfully redirected to the "Order Confirmation" page. The URL in the browser address bar correctly updated to `/status`. The "Order Confirmation" heading and "Thank you for your order" confirmation text were clearly visible on the page. No errors, unexpected behavior, or UI issues were observed throughout the entire order placement flow.
- **Pass/Fail:** Pass - The test case successfully validated the complete order placement flow in the development environment, confirming expected functionality and user experience.

##### Test Case 2: User Registration and Login Flow (Development Environment)

####  12.3.5. <a name='FormalTestingFrameworkandCodeCoverageCMP1002-5.3'></a>Formal Testing Framework and Code Coverage (CMP1002-5.3)

Our testing strategy leverages a comprehensive formal testing framework, encompassing unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend components.  We utilize Jest and Vitest as our primary testing frameworks, along with React Testing Library, Supertest, Jest DOM, and MSW for specialized testing needs, as detailed in the [Testing Frameworks](#testing-frameworks) section.

**Comprehensive Test Suite:**

- **Unit Tests:**  We have implemented extensive unit tests for individual functions, components, models, and middleware in both the frontend and backend. Unit tests focus on isolating and verifying the logic of individual code units in isolation.
- **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests validate the interactions between different modules and components.  Frontend integration tests verify component interactions and module integrations. Backend integration tests (using Supertest) validate API route integrations, controller logic, and middleware integration.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** While full automation of E2E tests is a future goal, we have conducted rigorous manual E2E testing in both development and production environments, as evidenced in the [Development E2E Testing Evidence](#development-e2e-testing-evidence-cmp1002-5.1) and [Production E2E Testing Evidence](#production-e2e-testing-evidence-cmp1002-5.2) sections. These manual E2E tests validate critical user flows across the entire application stack.
- **Backend Testing:**  Backend testing is comprehensive, covering controllers, middleware, models, and routes with both unit and integration tests.  API endpoints are thoroughly tested using Supertest to ensure correct request handling, response structures, and error handling.
- **Frontend Testing:** Frontend testing includes unit tests for utility functions and React components, and integration tests for component interactions and module integrations. React Testing Library is used to ensure components are tested from a user-centric perspective.

##  16. <a name='BackendErrorHandling'></a>Backend Error Handling

The backend implements centralized error handling using the `errorHandler` middleware. This middleware catches errors thrown in route handlers or other middleware, logs the error details, and sends a standardized error response to the client. Error responses typically include:

- `status`: HTTP status code indicating the error type (e.g., 400 for Bad Request, 500 for Internal Server Error).
- `message`: A user-friendly error message describing the error.
- `errors`: (Optional) An array of more detailed error objects, especially for validation errors.
- `stack`: (In development mode only) The error stack trace for debugging.

Specific error types are handled and mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes and messages to provide informative feedback to the frontend and users.

---

##  17. <a name='BackendAuthentication'></a>Backend Authentication

The backend implements robust authentication by verifying Firebase-generated JWT tokens, creating a secure and maintainable authentication system.

###  17.1. <a name='JWTAuthentication'></a>JWT Authentication

- **Firebase-Based Authentication:** Authentication is primarily handled in the frontend using Firebase Authentication. The backend's role is to verify these Firebase-generated JWT tokens.
- **Token Verification Process:** When the frontend makes requests to protected backend routes:
  - The Firebase-generated JWT is included in the request's `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
  - The backend's `authMiddleware` extracts this token from the request.
  - The middleware uses the Firebase Admin SDK to verify the token's authenticity and integrity.
  - If valid, the middleware extracts user information (UID, email, role) from the decoded token and attaches it to the request object (`req.user`).
  - If invalid or expired, the middleware returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
- **Protected Routes:** API endpoints requiring authentication are protected using the `authMiddleware`. Only requests with valid Firebase JWT tokens can access these routes.

###  17.2. <a name='OAuth2Authentication'></a>OAuth2 Authentication

- **Native Firebase OAuth Support:** Since authentication is handled through Firebase, the application inherently supports OAuth2-based login methods provided by Firebase Authentication, including:
  - Google Sign-In
  - Facebook Login
  - Apple ID
  - Other OAuth2 providers supported by Firebase

  > Our app only supports Google OAuth2

- **OAuth2 Flow Implementation:**
  1. User initiates OAuth2 login in the frontend application
  2. Firebase Authentication manages the entire OAuth2 flow with the provider
  3. Upon successful authentication, Firebase issues a JWT token
  4. This token is sent to the backend with subsequent API requests
  5. Backend verifies the token using Firebase Admin SDK, extracting user information and permissions

###  17.3. <a name='SecureRoutesandRole-BasedAccess'></a>Secure Routes and Role-Based Access

- **Secure Routes:** API endpoints requiring authentication are protected using the `authMiddleware`. Only requests with valid Firebase JWT tokens can access these routes.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The backend implements role-based access control by extracting the user's role from the verified Firebase token and restricting certain routes to specific roles (e.g., admin-only routes).

###  17.4. <a name='Logout'></a>Logout

- **Client-Side Logout:** Logout is handled on the frontend by calling Firebase's signOut method, which invalidates the user's session.
- **Stateless Authentication:** Since the backend uses stateless JWT verification, no backend logout action is required. Once the token is removed from the client, the user's session effectively ends.
