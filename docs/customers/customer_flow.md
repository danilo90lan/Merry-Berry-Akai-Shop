# Customer Flow

### 1. App Access and Onboarding

Customers visit the Merry Berry web application from their browser. They can either sign up or continue as a guest.

Customers can sign up using Social Login (Google, Apple, etc.) or Passkeys for authentication. This eliminates the need to store passwords and enhances security by using OAuth or public key authentication.

### 2. Browsing the Menu and Selecting Items

Customers land on the homepage , where they can view featured menu items and special promotions. The menu is categorised into Smoothies, Açaí Bowls, and Snacks & Add-ons.

Each menu item displays a name, description, ingredients, high-quality image, price, and customisation options such as adding extra toppings or changing portion sizes.

### 3. Cart Review and Checkout

Customers add items to their cart, adjusting quantities and customisations as needed.

The cart summary displays the selected items, modifications, an itemised cost breakdown, any applicable discounts or promotions, and an estimated pickup time based on the current order queue.

During checkout, customers select a payment method , including Credit/Debit Card (processed via Stripe), Apple Pay, or Google Pay. After confirming the order, payment is processed securely.

### 4. Order Confirmation and Preparation

An order number is assigned for easy identification. Customers can track the status of their order with simulated timer schemes, progressing through the following stages: Order placed, Being prepared, and Ready for pickup.

### 5. Pickup Process

Customers arrive at the Merry Berry store and provide their order number at the counter.
