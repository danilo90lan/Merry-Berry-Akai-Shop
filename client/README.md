### Testing Framework

- **Vitest:** A Vite-native testing framework that provides fast, modern testing capabilities
- **React Testing Library:** For testing React components in a user-centric way
- **Jest DOM:** Extended DOM element matchers for Jest
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker):** For mocking API requests during testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with coverage in watch mode
npm run test:coverage:watch
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests:** Testing individual functions and utilities (e.g., `orderUtils.test.js`)
- **Component Tests:** Testing React components in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Testing interactions between components
- **Mock Services:** Using mock implementations for external services

Example test from `orderUtils.test.js`:
```javascript
describe('formatOrderId', () => {
    test('should format a valid order ID', () => {
        expect(formatOrderId('5f8d0f1e3a2b68a5e42d7c18')).toBe('Order #7C18');
    });

    test('should return a default value for undefined order ID', () => {
        expect(formatOrderId(undefined)).toBe('Unknown Order');
    });
});
```

## Code Architecture

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principles

The application follows DRY principles throughout its codebase:

1. **Utility Functions:** Common operations are extracted into reusable utility functions (e.g., `orderUtils.js`, `formatters.js`)
2. **Component Composition:** Reusable UI components are created and composed together
3. **Context API:** Shared state is managed through React Context to avoid prop drilling
4. **Custom Hooks:** Reusable logic is encapsulated in custom hooks (e.g., `useApiStatus.js`)

Example from `orderUtils.js`:
```javascript
// Calculate the total price of an order item including toppings
export const calculateItemTotal = (item) => {
  const basePrice = item.product?.basePrice || 0;
  const quantity = item.quantity || 1;
  
  // Calculate toppings total
  const toppingsTotal = Array.isArray(item.toppings)
    ? item.toppings.reduce((sum, topping) => {
        const toppingPrice = topping.product?.basePrice || 0;
        const toppingQuantity = topping.quantity || 1;
        return sum + (toppingPrice * toppingQuantity);
      }, 0)
    : 0;
  
  return (basePrice * quantity) + toppingsTotal;
};
```

### Object-Oriented Principles/Patterns

The application implements several OO principles and patterns:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** React components encapsulate state and behavior
2. **Context Providers:** Implement the Provider pattern for state management
3. **Higher-Order Components:** Used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication
4. **Composition over Inheritance:** Components are composed rather than extended
5. **Factory Pattern:** Used in service creation and API client configuration

Example from `CartContext.jsx`:
```javascript
export const CartProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);
  const [cartTotal, setCartTotal] = useState(0);
  
  // Methods for cart operations
  const addToCart = (item) => {
    // Implementation
  };
  
  const removeFromCart = (itemId, customization, cartItemId) => {
    // Implementation
  };
  
  // More methods...
  
  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={{ cartItems, cartTotal, addToCart, removeFromCart, /* other values */ }}>
      {children}
    </CartContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Code Flow Control for User Stories

The application implements intuitive flow control for key user stories:

1. **Menu Browsing Flow:**
   - Category selection → Item filtering → Item details → Customization → Add to cart
   
2. **Checkout Flow:**
   - Cart review → Delivery information → Payment → Order confirmation
   
3. **Admin Management Flow:**
   - Authentication → Dashboard → Entity selection (menu items, categories, toppings) → CRUD operations

Each flow is implemented with appropriate state management, validation, and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## User Testing

To ensure a high-quality user experience and meet the assignment requirements, we conducted extensive user testing in both development and production environments. Key findings and resolutions from this testing are summarized below, with detailed feedback logs available in [Feedback.MD](Feedback.MD).

# User Testing Feedback

## Production Feedback (CMP1002-5.2)

To meet the HD criteria for CMP1002-5.2, we need to demonstrate evidence of extensive user-testing of the production site, including by the client.

**Reports:**

- **Report 1: Card payment not showing up, can't complete the payment for my order**
  - **Investigation:** API Returns 200, Front end didn't handle the payment intent data correctly.
  - **Resolution:** Fixed by changing the front end code to correctly handle payment intent data.
  - **Feedback for Production:**
    - **Positive:** The API was functioning correctly, indicating a robust backend.
    - **Negative:** The front-end payment handling was flawed, leading to a critical user flow issue.
    - **Action for Production:** Implement more rigorous front-end testing, especially for critical user flows like payment processing. Consider end-to-end testing in a staging environment that mirrors production.

- **Report 2: Got a something went wrong (ErrorBoundary) on the home screen.**
  - **Investigation:** Unable to find source due to no logs or stack traces on production. Suspected missing environment variable.
  - **Resolution:** Improved error handling for missing environment variables and implemented Sentry for production error logging with source maps.
  - **Feedback for Production:**
    - **Negative:** Lack of production logging made debugging difficult. Error handling for environment variables was insufficient.
    - **Action for Production:** Sentry implementation should significantly improve error monitoring and debugging in production. Regularly monitor Sentry for new errors and trends. Ensure all necessary environment variables are documented and their absence is gracefully handled.

- **Report 3: Menu filter chips on the menu page don't do anything (User stories)**
  - **Investigation:** Filter chips were visual placeholders without implemented functionality.
  - **Resolution:**  Acknowledged as missing functionality, planned for future development if required by user stories.
  - **Feedback for Production:**
    - **Negative:**  Discrepancy between UI elements and actual functionality can be confusing for users.
    - **Action for Production:**  For production, either implement the filter chip functionality or remove them if they are not part of the MVP and user stories.  Avoid visual placeholders that suggest functionality that is not present.

## Development Feedback (CMP1002-5.1)

To meet the HD criteria for CMP1002-5.1, we need to demonstrate evidence of extensive user-testing in the development environment. This feedback focuses on how to improve development testing to prevent production issues, especially considering the app seemed to function correctly in development.

**Feedback for Development based on Production Issues (Development Environment Testing):**

The issues encountered in production, despite the app appearing to function correctly in development, highlight critical gaps in our development testing and environment parity.  It's crucial to refine our development processes to better mirror production conditions and catch these errors earlier.

- **Payment Issue:**
  - **Development Feedback:** Front-end unit and integration tests for payment processing were insufficient to catch the production issue.  The development environment may not have accurately replicated the production API response or Stripe integration.
  - **Action for Development:**
    - **Improve Test Environment Parity:**  Strive to make the development and testing environments as close to production as possible. This includes using similar API configurations, database setups (if feasible), and dependency versions.
    - **Mock Production API Responses:**  Incorporate mocking of external API responses in tests to ensure consistent and predictable behavior, regardless of the actual API environment. Pay special attention to mocking edge cases and error scenarios from the API.
    - **End-to-End Testing in Staging:** Implement end-to-end tests in a staging environment that closely mirrors production. This will help catch integration issues that unit and integration tests might miss.

- **ErrorBoundary Issue:**
  - **Development Feedback:** The absence of logging in production made debugging difficult, but the fact that this wasn't caught in development suggests logging and error monitoring were also insufficient in the development environment.
  - **Action for Development:**
    - **Consistent Logging Strategy:** Implement and enforce a consistent logging strategy across development, staging, and production environments. Use similar logging libraries and configurations in all environments.
    - **Development Error Monitoring:** Set up a development error monitoring tool (similar to Sentry, but for development) to capture and analyze errors during development. This will help identify issues that might be missed during manual testing.
    - **Environment Variable Validation in Development:**  Implement stricter validation of environment variables in the development environment to catch missing or misconfigured variables early on.

- **Menu Filter Chips Issue:**
  - **Development Feedback:**  While not an error, the presence of non-functional UI elements in production points to a lack of thorough user story and acceptance criteria validation during development.
    - **Action for Development:**  Ensure UI elements are functional or clearly indicate if they are placeholders.  During development, prioritize implementing core functionalities over visual enhancements.  User story mapping and acceptance criteria should clearly define the functionality of UI elements.

**General Development Feedback:**

- **Testing:**  Increase the coverage and depth of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Focus on testing critical user flows and edge cases.
- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging across the application for debugging and monitoring during development and production.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling throughout the application to provide informative error messages and prevent unexpected crashes.
- **Environment Variables:**  Standardize environment variable handling and validation across the application. Ensure clear documentation for all required environment variables.
- **User Story Implementation:**  Ensure all UI elements and functionalities are directly linked to user stories and acceptance criteria. Avoid implementing visual elements without corresponding functionality.
- **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to catch potential issues early in the development process. Focus on error handling, testing, and adherence to best practices.
