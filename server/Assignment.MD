Assessment

Policies

Written assessments are usually due on Sunday at 11:55pm on the week they are due. Please check the Assignments page in

Canvas for the exact due date and time of each assessment event.

You will have a maximum of 5 days (including weekend days and public holidays) to submit if the due assessments are 'late'.

5% points will be deducted for each day the assessment was late, up to a maximum of 5 days. After the 5 day period the

assessment will need to be submitted to the academic teacher via their official AIT email and will be marked for feedback

purposes, but will receive a grade of zero (0).

Refer to the latest version of the Late Submission Policy

(https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/493379/Assessment%20Late%20Submission%20Assessment%20Policy_09112020_V1.0.pdf)

Introduction

As an aspiring developer, it is important to be able to communicate and demonstrate your abilities to prospective employers.

A full stack developer needs to be able to demonstrate they can build a complete application from design through to deployment for a commercial

client (using appropriate tools and methodologies).

Full Stack App - Part B requires you to deliver the coding component of of this project, with accompanying documentation.

Brief

- Part A .

The project must be completed in the assigned groups.

Requirements

Requirements for this project are divided into three major parts,

1. Code
2. Documentation
3. Presentation

CODE REQUIREMENTS

At a minimum use the following technologies:

MongoDB

Express

React

Node

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Documentation for this project must be supplied as part of the following documents,

1. README document

README document

General project documentation is to be compiled as a single markdown file named README.md . This file should contain standard documentation in

the form of the following requirements:

R10 A link (URL) to your deployed website

R11 A link to your GitHub repository (repo)

Ensure the repo is accessible by your educators!

R12 The contents of your README.md as submitted for Full Stack App - Part A

PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Your presentation must:

No. Requirement

R13 Be no longer than ten (10) minutes in duration

R14

a conditional statement

You may also be required to answer any questions from your Educators and the audience

Submission

This project must be submitted via Canvas

Your submission is to be a single zip file (organised as described in the Deliverables section below)

FILE

Follow the steps below to correctly prepare file(s) to submit,

1. Create a directory called,

{Fullname}_T3A2-B

Where,

{Fullname} is to be replaced by your Fullname

T1A3 is this Assignment’s ID.

2. Organize all the files for submission in this directory
3. Create a zip file of this directory called,

{Fullname}_T3A2-B.zip

A sample command that can be run in Mac OS X/Linux terminal to achieve creation of the zip file is as follows,

zip -r {Fullname}_T3A2-B.zip {Fullname}_T3A2-B

4. Submit this zip file in Canvas

Example

If your name is Luke Skywalker ,

1. The directory you create will be called LukeSkywalker_T3A2-B

mkdir LukeSkywalker_T3A2-B

2. Organize all the files for submission in this directory
3. Create a zip file of this directory. The zip file will be named LukeSkywalker_T3A2-B.zip

zip -r LukeSkywalker_T3A2-B.zip LukeSkywalker_T3A2-B

4. Submit LukeSkywalker_T3A2-B.zip in Canvas

DELIVERABLES

Following is a list of deliverables (which should cover all the above requirments) to include in your submission. The table also details how the

information should be orghanized.

Deliverable Description Location (in Zip

file)

README.md General project documentation is to be compiled as a single markdown file named README.md .

/

(Root folder of

your zip file)

Resources All files linked by the README.md file must be included in a folder named docs . All resources included

in this folder must be in either png , jpeg , pdf , or markdown ( md ) format docs/

Presentation Slide deck of your presentation in pdf format ppt/

Source

Code Source code for your entire project src/

Note: All links to online material should have corresponding screenshots included in submission.

DEADLINE

You are responsible for submitting this assessment before the deadline date/time. Your assessment submission-time is set and logged by Canvas

once your entire submission is uploaded and submitted in the system. This submission-time is used to verify on time submission or determine if yo

are liable for any late submission penalties.

Slow internet speeds, long submission/upload times, delay in uploading, etc are NOT grounds for special consideration (i.e. for waiving of any

applicable late penalty).

Remember for any valid special consideration request, relevant and full support documentation MUST be provided. The outcome of the special

consideration request will be determined by Academic management and not your Educators.
